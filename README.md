# godot-4-TileDraw
Drawing Tiles using draw func / subViewPort

[EDIT],

upDated "testedel2.tscn", all working
press "run current scene" button ( F6 )... 

- Making an editor plugIn,
- run scene testedel2.tscn
- Select the tile/tiles in the image,
- Tiles can be drawn outside of the image area,
- added tile groups instead of an entire tile image ( testedel.tscn )

This project its in a very early stage. Iam adding it to gitHub now, has a motivation
to keep me doing it and finishen it.


Now that "godot4 tileMap" flips/rotations are done and have been added, this "tileDraw editor" is useless, 
hopefully i will be able to finished it, and give the user and myself enough understanding and experience, 
that coding a tileSet is not something very difficult to do.
