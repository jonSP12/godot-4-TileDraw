[EDIT],

upDated "testedel2.tscn", all working
press "run current scene" button ( F6 )... 

- Making an editor plugIn,
- new scene added testedel2.tscn in folder test2
- Select the tile/tiles in the image,
- tile groups are now drawn instead of an entire tile image has they were in ( testedel.tscn )
- left mouse button draw/select tiles, right mouse button eraser
